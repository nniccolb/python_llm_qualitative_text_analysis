If they don’t know about it, I stat to ask random people about it, like on a bus or in the metro. Let’s say I would want to collect wild herbs, and I don’t know anything about it – I ask someone if they know about that thing. Have you been? Are you interested? I think its the easiest to learn in a group, rather than alone.\n",

I use it to look only the things I want to and that’s why I don’t follow anyone on Instagram – just profiles I think other people can find through my profile.

      "- My screen time is 1h 15min a day, or 50 minutes. Not that much.\n",
      "- How do you feel about that time?\n",
      "- Contradictory. I know that if I would really want to take my career further – I know the weight social media has – if I would do it 3 hours a day, I would see more results. But at the same time, the one hour a day feels like a lot – its 7 hours from your week and I’m thinking I would rather paint for 7 hours. So its contradictory when I know I could do more, but I’m anxious about that time, its too much.\n",
      "- Do you save content? If yes, how/where?\n",
      "- Yes I save a lot of things on Instagram. The saving is really messy. Sometimes I save by liking, and sometimes I actually save, but I don’t have a clear routine for it. What is the reason I liked something and the other one I saved? And then I have not once in my new profile organized them. And then I feel anxious about going to see them. Because its a thing – I really often save things that are really educational, and I say that I’m going to see it later – and its a way of procrastinating. I know that I should learn that thing, or do that thing, but by saving I just stretch doing it for real. I feel like my saves are messy, they would need organization, but I’m like scared of going there, haha.\n",
      "- What is your vision of that order?\n",
      "- That Instagram is way too messy. It could be clearer. It would be nice if you could just – when I open my phone the things would be in squares that I can open, and have a picture on top.\n",
      "- So the things would be grouped?\n",
      "- Yeah they would be visible in categorized and with a picture, so it would be visual. For example food, it would say food – and I would want to name it myself.\n",
      "- But on the other hand I’m interested in a theory that what if I don’t need to name them – but I could just organize them somehow.\n",
      "- Which one do you want most: organizing them or having them organized?\n",
      "- Now I’m starting to think, there is so many possibilities…\n",
      "- Yes, so if anything would be possible?\n",
      "- Well maybe that some machine organizes them for me, haha. It would be convenient that you could move them around,  but I’m interested in seeing how the machine would organize them based on what I have saved. How the machine would organize them? That would be really interesting.\n",
      "- How do you feel about customized feeds, like TikTok for you or Instagram explore pages?\n",
      "- I have been thinking if its that I’m really curating them with my choices, or am I curating anything? I don’t know if its how I think it is. *Chicken & Egg problem: interacting with posts to get more of them, but who showed you the first one to interact with and to to that rabbit hole?*\n",
      "- Youtube quite bullshit, because its really addicting, at least for me. I have been doing exercises towards not just going there. There are channels I feel like they know everything about me, which for me is really interesting. Its weird – always when I open it I see five videos I want to see. Then I open them on new tabs and refresh, and then open four new videos and then I have so many open tabs. Then I spend half a day watching stupid videos. And then I find new ones from the side of the video etc. It’s not fresh.\n",
      "- You can see the difference if you go to my friends Youtube or if I go to Youtube without any account – the feeling is sick. There is just some war videos and something, its sick. I feel really weird about it. Also when I made a new Facebook account to sell my things, and then I didn’t know they also have reels and I went there by accident. I was shocked, there were terrible videos like someone giving birth or a big snake or something – I was panicking that I don’t want to see this. I felt so bad, what if someone doesn’t know how these things work? There isn’t any teaching around this for people. That is questionable. I got scared.\n",
      "- If I want to develop myself, how can I do that if the algorithms are feeding me content at the “same level” I am now. If a person has been there for years watching some brutal videos, how can they get out of it? Its a trap I think.\n",
      "- Instagram is interesting, since there is a lot of good information, but also a lot of harmful information. Even though that information would look like its helpful at first. When I’m studying things there, there is a lot of wu wu.\n",

      "- I don’t have time to think about it. I know there is BeReal or something, but I don’t have the energy for it. Even now it feels hard to learn something, even things I need, like the software in a camera. Learning new things has slowed down.\n",
      "- Why do you think that is?\n",
      "- Maybe my age, haha. I still learn, but not at the same as when I was 12. I was playing games, doing web magazines and blogs, but now I learned how to code a website for a year. It took me a year to learn what the things are there. It has slowed down. Now even using Instagram reels – I don’t have time to learn it and if there are new apps coming all the time, I just don’t have the energy or time to learn how those work, that’s the thing. I would rather use my time learning something I know will be useful for me, like doing a website.\n",

A lot of things I’m like “on” and know that what I’m seeing is wrong. I’m pretty aware of it actually, what is true content and what isn’t. But in terms of if I see a nice shirt somewhere, that doesn’t really matter, that’s the type of content I’m not thinking if it’s trustworthy or not. In terms of news or tips, I’m skeptical about it.\n",

I’m more convinced with seeing results of a tip, for example. If it’s not sponsored, a thing I can research myself more, a normal girl, my age.

Pinterest I use for almost everything, outfits and furniture. Bereal sometimes, Snapchat is then for communication. VSCO: Uses to post with lower barrier than Instagram, Instagram is not for random stuff. More of camera roll, it is more private in a way since just less people know VSCO.\n",

      "- Private for me and if I want to share a video I can, I would have them for myself and look at it later on.\n",
      "- Did not tap on “posting” on the proto, probably would only scroll and not post things. I feel that everything I look at is pretty basic and if there is something I am very passionate about I would share. Do you do it now ? I do not. Previous behavior tells us a lot! Curation is not something she would instantly at least do.\n",

      "- How did these two versions make you feel?\n",
      "- First one is very simple, second was too much to understand. Second option is more exciting, but it was too much to process. Much more fun to use since there is more things to do than just “look up stuff”. Need social aspect to it, does not like just the individual use. VCSO does not have interaction, commenting etc. and that bothers. Therefore, on second proto when you had posts that other people curate, it becomes more interesting and better.\n",

      "- If I see someone tagged on an influencers photo I follow that seems cool I go to their profile. Usually it’s through other people. On TikTok I find a lot of new Instagram profiles there.\n",
      "- It’s such a random feed on TikTok *(in a good way)*. Instagram it’s who you follow and similar people based on those, so there is a lot of similar content.\n",
      "- What factors prevent you from solving problems that occur?\n",

      "- If it’s to find certain kind of content there would be some kind of search on the main page of it. Then underneath a variety of different channel posts that are linked to the topic, or without searching it would have posts related to something you have looked up before. Or something a lot of other people have looked at before.\n",
      "- Reposting to Instagram stories?\n",
      "- I like it when other people repost to their stories. People repost memes, but a lot of cool posts as well and I enjoy that a lot. I can go click on the profile they reposted from.\n",

      "- Yeah, I would say so.\n",

      "- Does it make you post more on stories when you know it’s not going to be there forever?\n",

      "- Probably source.\n",
      "- What do you dislike about filters in general or here?\n",
      "- Some filters can be too specific and it ends up narrowing down the search too much. Leaves out a lot of things that could have been interesting.\n",
      "- If you are looking for a photo you can filter into the pictures, there are probably other platforms with photos than Instagram. I like that you can filter for the source as well, if you remember a certain thing, but don’t remember which platform it was from, so you can select through those.\n",

      "- Yeah, I do that on Pinterest. I have boards for different topics. In that sense that’s the same. The feed is similar to VSCO, the images are randomly sized, which I like. I would put them in a chronological order based of of when you saved.\n",
      "- VSCO\n",
      "- I do like it. I just put highlights from my photos there in a chronological order. Some of my friends I follow there, but its for myself really. When I downloaded that I went through all my photos to add them. Curated camera roll.\n",

      "- How much does the person that shared or created the content weight in your decision to explore the content further?\n",
      "- If it’s an influencer I follow that would say something about a product, of course many influencers are paid so you don’t know it it’s true, but you would like to thing the people you follow are honest. I do put a lot of trust in the people.\n",

      "- *Positive reaction.* I like that. I like that idea, because with TikTok its easy to share them, but with podcasts it’s harder to share other than word of mouth. Also songs. So I like the concept of being able to share.\n",

      "- Yes. I would say I use it often.\n",
      "- Adding with a link vs. share sheet?\n",
      "- It depends. If I’m just listening to a podcast a share sheet could be easy. But if its something  I have already saved, on Pinterest, being able to paste a link could be easier.\n",

      "- Would you like to pick which category it goes to?\n",
      "- I don’t know. Some things you can’t really categorize either. Would it filter it with an AI thing?\n",
      "- It could be\n",
      "- And if it puts it in a wrong category then you could change that. It already takes time to share the things on there, so also putting it in a separate category would be too much.\n",
      "- Would you like to name categories yourself?\n",
      "- Yes, maybe. If it would be just me categorizing for myself then probably yeah. Kinda similar to Pinterest, naming the boards. But I like that those are basic as well, plain categories. And then there would be “other” for random things, haha.\n",

      "- Who could this be good for?\n",
      "- I don’t know if many younger people, as in like teenagers, would find it helpful. I think definitely for 18+ year olds. I feel like my mom would use a platform like this, she puts so much stuff on Instagram. The amount of dog videos that woman sends me on Instagram…\n",
      "- A niche group of people?\n",
      "- I don’t know. The content you can post is so wide and varied. Younger people do listen to podcasts, but I feel like it’s content that older people would share more. But then also photos and music would be something for a younger audience. My mom listens to a lot of audiobooks, is that something you could share? Those are popular. That’s how I read most of the books I do, through other peoples recommendations. People don’t share that type of information too much, but it’s so interesting to know what someone is reading.\n",

But the problem on Twitter is that everything expires in half an hour – I don’t have the energy for that, I have other things to do.

For me some of these *(contents)* I have seen before. To make the app more yours, you would see a lot of content you wouldn’t see on other platforms. I think that’s the most important thing because when you go an look at other platforms, you see a lot of same things and I don’t think that’s what you want. But I like this a lot, also podcasts as a source could be nice. I like that there are different formats – video, audio – very helpful.

I think its a good balance here since I can choose. I like the way I can filter here instead on other websites. *Highlighting that other people do that, but filtering is not the behavior for her.

But it’s also really inspiring to see one of your favourite stylists, for example, references and where they get them and why, where they get their ideas. It depends on the person. Personally I would share it, on and off. Maybe share a few, but not all. But I think sharing your saves is a cool idea.\n",

      "- If you could add any feature to it, or possibility to do on it, what would you add?\n",
      "- I just like the content itself. I wish the content would in the future be not too similar to the other platforms - like when you go on Google and you see three links saying the same thing. For example, I like that on wellness I have glucose etc. *(subcategories)…* Cohesive. If I would see content that is not on any other platform, that would attract way more consumers.\n",
      "- Would unique content be the biggest thing for you to adopt to a new platform, this feeling of newness?\n",
      "- Yes, but also a lot of things that might be old. Because I think things from the past are more helpful. Because today other people use peoples needs to create content, and they post things that they know people want to see. But sometimes I think its nice to see content that people just do things for themselves. And thats something you wouldn’t normally see.\n",
      "- What would you see the main use for yourselves: curation or searching and research?\n",
      "- For me, I would say more search and research. But I know for people who have jobs in content creation the other could be nice. So I think a mix of both, and to have the freedom to have both. People are often indecisive and sometimes want to post and other times don’t want to post – so having that option of having both is really good as well.\n",
      "- Do you think that this unique content thats important for you would still apply if people would curate their content? Curate like an old podcast, an old article – and this type of curation behavior, would it make the content seem unique even though its created before? Or should it be created as a new content?\n",
      "- I think a mix of both, I don’t think its much of that. I like looking at peoples archives, hidden stuff, and what you don’t see a lot. When it comes to magazines, books, images that are hidden… When it comes to image searching it comes down to stuff that is really unique and not out there for you to be able to create nice content.\n",
      "- I would love to understand, do you read newspapers or do you use social media to know what is going on in the world or in your community?\n",
      "- Social media for sure. But also when it comes to the image searching I like to go to the library, since many things in books are not in social media. It would be cool to have magazine scans, magazines that are not online. When I don’t have access to library I would like to see scanned things, that would be really helpful.\n",

My mechanism is I save it for later,  like in Youtube I save it to “watch later” and on podcasts I save it as a bookmark.

      "- It requires initially my own research. I need to find the right accounts, or profiles. Recommendations of course are helpful in Youtube and Instagram. I usually discover something on one platform and then start searching it on other platforms too. Saving depends on if I find or I’m recommended a post, and then I start saving them.\n",

That part is not so nice, but I can’t get rid of those either, they are everywhere. It’s relevant and not relevant at the same time. *Could want to block some topics / have specific things shown.*\n",

      "- Thinking… Saving is one of the methods. Otherwise, I try not to follow distracting things. So that the recommendation algorithm recommends – but it recommends those anyway. Not easy to solve, this distraction part.\n",
      "- How much time do you spend across these platforms?\n",
      "- Depends on my day, but on the days I listen to a podcast for example, it could be 1h in a podcast or Youtube. Instagram could be anything from 20 minutes to an hour.\n",
      "#########################\n",
      "- How do you imagine a tool like this would work and help you?\n",
      "- What would really help is to have a good searching tool. At the moment in Youtube I can search, there it works kinda okay, but on Instagram I can’t search the things I have saved, for example. On Instagram I can’t really find it from my saves, I need to go through them. In Youtube its easier. All these influencer and good content has shifted to Instagram from Youtube. Maybe if they are connected by categories, instead of me switching from apps to apps, there could be one platform as you said, and I could find things from all platforms. *Even though uses folders for saves on Instagram, having a search would help even more.*\n",
      "[Prototype: 1. Individual](\n",
      "- What are your thoughts?\n",
      "- From a design perspective there is no clear separation between one post and another from different platforms. At first glance it’s hard to see the difference. I guess now it doesn’t have it but it would show videos from Instagram? And this part is trending part? Or recommendations? *(Podcasts horizontal scroll).*\n",
      "- What made you tap on that category & format?\n",
      "- I think its straight forward. Seems fine. Maybe if multiple of them could be selected that could be better.\n",
      "- What makes you think its going to be worth the tap / relevant for you? Why did you tap on certain sources?\n",
      "- I think I would tap on the socials I use. I don’t haven’t entered the TikTok world and I don’t want to get to TikTok yet. I don’t have Spotify, I use Apple Podcasts – if you would have that I would use that. I have been away from Twitter for a long time too… I would use platforms I already use.\n",
      "- How do you feel about the filters?\n",
      "- Long silence. Yeah, pretty essential things, I don’t know what could be additional things.\n",
      "- Do you think filtering content in this way would be something you approach or does it seem like something you wouldn’t do?\n",
      "- I guess if there are enough categories or it has categories that I’m interested in. Wellness is quite broad. I usually use specific words on Youtube. I wouldn’t use very general or broad categories, there would be so many results anyways. I would probably use categories and search in the first page, combine those two, or then just search.\n",
      "- What do you think about following categories instead of people?\n",
      "- It’s a different way to think about it. I think categories are nice, because it’s easier to search with categories than to search people that you don’t know exist yet.. I like the category idea, it needs to be more refined for me to be useful. But getting into a topic its a nice way. *Beginners could benefit from categories – she knows what to search for.*\n",
      "- Thoughts on more niche subcategories?\n",
      "- I think its pretty good. It could be used to learn new things, since some topic might not exist until you encounter it. To discover new topics. Otherwise these more refined things about health, like womens health, is really nice.\n",
      "[Prototype: 2. Perspectives](\n",
      "- People have brought the information, and you can follow people etc. What do you think?\n",
      "- Includes the usernames and more social interaction, like your friends liked it and saved it and so on. *Noticed the recommendation system texts.* Nice to give credit to the content creators. *So maybe didn’t notice source text on the individual one, or at least more focus here.* It’s nice to see their pictures up there, also seeing your friends interactions. *Mentioned friends again.* And here you can follow people, or you can follow categories?\n",
      "- Yes you can follow categories but then you could follow people who would create the content or share others content\n",
      "- This is also nice, you can still use categories, but then if you like one content creator you can also follow him/her.\n",
      "- What makes you follow a person?\n",
      "- If they produce meaningful content for me, they don’t create so much noise, but they share important topics.\n",
      "- How do you find these individuals?\n",
      "- Years of experience, AI algorithms know me better now. For podcasts, it’s common that they invite guests and thats how you discover a person, for example. For food recipes, I usually search my own things on Google, like if I have leftover food I Google with that. On Instagram it works with the recommendations, it knows what I like, it keeps recommending me those things. For other things that come to my mind I just use search.\n",
      "- What makes you unfollow a person?\n",
      "- If I realize I’m not interested in their content anymore. Then I usually unfollow.\n",
      "- Have you had an experience where you wished you could only follow part of the person?\n",
      "- I mean yeah, I would appreciate if this searching process is easier in general. Especially on Instagram, Instagram is not built for searching. But now, many people use it for finding different types of content. In Youtube you need to go through all the videos to know if its something you like. With podcasts also not easy to search since you have to find right key words.\n",
      "- If you follow someone on Instagram, are you fine with following everything that they post? Would you like to pick a theme from different ones, have you had a situation when you would like to follow only a certain theme that person is creating content from?\n",
      "- For sure. Some influencers just share everything from their lives. For some people I am interested in all of their life. But for some influencers, I’m not interested in all of their lives. Some accounts do it very well, like only show recipes, these doctors and stuff they only share useful information, they are nice. But if a person shares more about their personal life that I’m not interested in, I unfollow usually.\n",
      "- Do you express yourself on social media? If so, how?\n",
      "- I think I do on Instagram. I like sharing the information I find nice on stories. I don’t post on feed that often, but I like using stories and reels lately.\n",
      "- Someone elses content or?\n",
      "- It could be that, or something from my travels. My own insights.\n",
      "- Are you part of any digital communities etc. where people share content ?\n",
      "- Instagram there is closed friends option. There I share if I want to write something in my native language, I only have my Turkish friends there. I don’t want to spam everybody. But on other platforms no.\n",
      "- Explanation about digital identity through sharing interesting things, Jennys profile: she has shared content from others on her profile. What is your approach to that?\n",
      "- So these are the things she recommends, not like she took these pictures? What she is reading and listening?\n",
      "- Yeah, when you would click those it would say it’s a Youtube video by someone else and it would take it to their profile, but she has recommended these for you, curated valuable information.\n",
      "- Yeah, quite nice. I think it’s good to have categories here too, I think after one year this page would be very populates. It would be nice to have the source, video, text, audio… here as well.\n",
      "- How do you feel about having saved posts in one page, other people or having your own?\n",
      "- It resembles Instagram stories, but instead its not disappearing in 24 hours.\n",
      "#########################\n",
      "- How did these two different versions make you feel?\n",
      "- First one was still nice and it was very plain, just category based. This one (perspectives) has more functionality and I like to include people. I’m sure content creators would like to have their own profiles. This second one gives more social platform feeling and it’s nice to have the people.\n",
      "- What could be the most useful feature for you?\n",
      "- Like I said and mentioned before you showed me the prototype, searching everything this way would be easier. I’m not sure what type of search algorithm is behind this, but if it’s good it’s really nice to have everything in one platform instead of me going to all three apps separately. Creating my own I think – was it curated – list of posts, it’s nice. Keep everything in one place. *Curating is a new term, but the concept of curating is more familiar.*\n",
      "- What could be the least useful feature for you?\n",
      "- *Long silence.* I don’t know yet, since there aren’t many features either. Hmm, filters, search, save button… Maybe the categories are too broad, I mean I want categories, but they are broad.\n",
      "- Who could this be good for?\n",
      "- I think for everyone who uses social media actively. Might not be too useful for people who use only Instagram, for example. But for someone like me who uses Youtube, Instagram and podcasts it would be nice.\n",
      "#########################\n",
      "FILE: 8.txt\n",
      "- Can you take me through the last time you tried to find information on a specific topic, recommendations or just staying up to date?\n",
      "- I think everyday, because I do working in marketing. Figuring out trends. I try to figure how to communicate with customers and multiple customer touch points etc. I use Google. I found this AI that is called Agent AI(?) and you just give it a prompt and it gives you all the info you need, like statistics. Sometimes I use Pinterest, sometimes I use Instagram. I don’t like it, but sometimes I need to go on TikTok.\n",
      "- What type of role does social media play in your life?\n",
      "- Very predominant role. Uses it daily. I do check out what is happening in the world and what is trending, what is new and what is not. Because I’m into skincare I follow influencers there, but then those are paid so all of that is not working.\n",
      "- Do you use Youtube at all?\n",
      "- I mean I use Youtube, but its more for when I don’t understand a topic and it has someone explain it. I don’t really use it to watch someone vlog or watch product recommendations – I don’t do it for that. Because I just know that a lot of the content on Youtube is for ratings. A lot of it is also for marketing purposes, so a lot of the reviews are biased.\n",
      "- How much time do you spend across these platforms?\n",
      "- Screen time is 5 hours a day on social networks.\n",
      "- How do you feel about that time?\n",
      "- If I just passively scroll through, then its a no. But a lot of it is for work, so I don’t feel as guilty about it. *Still, feels like its a topic she “should” be guilty about?* Out of my personal capacity – 5 hours is a lot.\n",
      "- But it’s hard to find real authentic content, because people wanting to go viral, wanting views, likes, beat the algorithm etc. these days.\n",
      "- Is the content you see often relevant or irrelevant for you during those 5 hours?\n",
      "- I think its a combination of both. I don’t scroll for 5 hours straight, but if I need to find something I go on and search. But I do find sometimes when I’m on there for a work thing, I’m like “oo what is this” and get out of track a bit. And I do use my social media in a way that the timeline is curated and is mostly relevant for me. I like posts based on what I want to see more. Even if I see something funny, but not as relevant, I don’t like it – just because I don’t want to mess up my zen feeling and having unnecessary people show up.\n",
      "- How do you feel about customized feeds, like TikTok for you or Instagram explore pages?\n",
      "- I think when we talk about hyper personalization, its one thing – but I think social media shouldn’t be controlled to that extend. It also creates a bubble for that person. Sometimes something might not be relevant for me today, but it might be relevant tomorrow. So I think social media shouldn’t be controlled in a way that I can only see things you want me to see, I think I should have access to anything. And then I should regulate for myself what I want and don’t want to see.\n",
      "- Do you save content? If yes, how/where?\n",
      "- Yes, if I’m like I want to recreate this video or a TikTok. Or if I really like a Youtube video, I will save it. So yes, I save all the time. But I have like over a thousand things I never go back to. I have tried to clean it up, but it requires too much work. Everyday I keep saving new stuff and keep saying I will get back to it but I don’t.\n",
      "- Do you feel like you would want to go back to them or not really?\n",
      "- Yeah, earlier especially on Instagram, you needed to scroll all the way down, but now you can put them on all different folders. So it’s easier to go through all the different content, because I can go to specific topics.\n",
      "- Is there still something that could be better on the Instagram saved folders?\n",
      "- Yeah. The one thing I actually hate is that you first need to save it and then put it in a folder – I would like it to automatically go to a folder. Extra step there, now its saved, now choose a folder… No, it should be like I click there “add” and it should say which folder you want to add it to, or if you want to create a folder directly.\n",
      "- What do you think about new platforms like Threads by Instagram?\n",
      "- For example like Threads, I have a whole another thing about Threads, because I know Threads is not on Finland. My cousins were calling me “Where do you live, under a rock? How come you are not on Threads?”. So, I don’t know, if you delete someone from Threads you delete them from Instagram and vice versa.\n",
      "- And I think Threads is highly regulated. I’m not with using platforms that are highly regulated. Because regulation and censorship can go both ways. I think people should have the right to say what they want to say. I believe as long as its not misogynistic, racist or totally terroristic. Freedom of speech is a basic human right. I think Threads is very regulated.\n",
      "- And they sell your data as well, since thats what Meta is known for – selling your data. Its like a whole conversation.\n",
      "- The fact that Threads is connected to Instagram makes it easier for someone to go from a new platform. But once your Instagram gets hacked, your Threads gets hacked. So I believe in different passwords and having different personas on different social media platforms.\n",
      "- Maybe if it was a bit like Twitter – even though Twitter is in a pit right now. But at least its a separate entity of its own. Its still under the same umbrella.\n",
      "- So you would like to keep them separate?\n",
      "- Yeah separated in a way, yeah. I think there should be a space to just share visual content, I don’t think everything should be in the same app – it just creates a lot of confusion.\n",
      "#########################\n",
      "- How do you imagine a tool like this would work and help you?\n",
      "- Like an open ended(?) tool that can… It depends like content in which way? Is it like more making it uncensored… making more sure that its like user generated content, or is it more like reducing paid content so that you can get more organic feedback? I think its multifaceted.\n",
      "- But a platform that tries to solve the content issue that we have right now with finding content – because it is hard, its oversaturated now, but then the question is how are you going to deal with the over saturation? And dealing with over saturation means it has to be censored to a certain degree, so how is that going to work? Without actually violating someones rights to share whatever they want to share and letting them freely share what they want to share.\n",
      "- And then possibly – how would the marketing go, since the app needs to make money somehow, so how would all of that go? The monetization side of the platform. Because that usually comes from a lot of ads on apps, and so…\n",
      "- How do you feel about ads on social media as a content consumer?\n",
      "- It depends… Not the way Twitter does it. Twitter sells ad space on everything that is trending, so when you click on something, you don’t see what is trending but all of these ads and you are like “what is this?”.\n",
      "- I think all of these ads that are relevant for me, and not just geographically – because I know Instagram does geographically and then I see things I’m not interested in – but more like what I’m interested in as an individual. And then combine that with the geographical info, like why I’m interested in that. I think then those ads are great.\n",
      "- On Youtube they select specific audiences for ads that run in between, so yeah, something like that. Having ads shown that are relevant for me, that is good. I think there should be something in the code that makes people understand that this person has seen this ad 11 times, and I don’t need to see it every day even though the person paid for it to be shown everyday. I don’t need to see it everyday.\n",
      "[Prototype: 1. Individual](\n",
      "- What do you think about this?\n",
      "- Umm, it seems great, like a platform where you can see things in one place.\n",
      "- Do you usually use filters when searching something, for example when buying something online?\n",
      "- No, I don’t use…  Like filters? I just check what I like, usually when I go shopping I look for what I like or go to the inspiration section of the website.\n",
      "- How do you feel about the filters here?\n",
      "- I mean they look great… Um, I like that you can find all the content here, wether its from Youtube, TikTok, its all here.\n",
      "- What do you dislike about them or the page in general?\n",
      "- Yeah, I think the UX is a bit, could be a bit better, like the picking the thing. *(Filters)* But other than that its okay, some of the fonts could increase a bit. But other than that, it looks okay how its set. I would put the formats under the source, because I think people would click on Instagram first, for example. I don’t know if they would go to the format, that would be a bit later. Because I don’t understand, like if you go to Spotify, does Spotify have video? *Did not sound convinced.*  \n",
      "- Would you filter content only from the sources you use now or others?\n",
      "- I think that depends on the end goal. Because each of these platforms have a different algorithm, all the content are a bit different. So if I’m looking just for wellness stuff in general, no matter the platform, then obviously just pressing wellness and say like video, picture – that’s fine. But if I’m wanting to see what is actually trending on wellness Instagram, wellness TikTok, wellness Youtube – then I would choose the source.\n",
      "- What is your initial feeling about following categories instead of individuals?\n",
      "- Um, following categories is great, but what if I don’t want to listen to a podcast, but I would really want to see the visuals of that certain category? Am I able to do that? S*etting default filters for followed categories.*\n",
      "[Prototype: 2. Perspectives](\n",
      "- What do you think about this version?\n",
      "- Oh, okay – *A bit more positive first reaction.* Would this be someones personal profile? Like is it everything they like? Oh okay so its the posts someone has saved and you can follow the same posts for inspiration basically?\n",
      "- Yeah this is more about the digital identity thing, you could follow people and see what they are interested in, what do they read, listen to etc.\n",
      "- *Went to the curate page and share sheet journey from Instagram, but didn’t understand it.*\n",
      "- So I could basically put out all my content on other social platforms and then like them on here and then be like guys check it out – cool…\n",
      "- From the plus button you could add posts with a link or in what you went through earlier, you could add posts from Instagram\n",
      "- Oh so I can add my own posts on to the platform? From Instagram? As a link and then its going to come up like this for other people to see?\n",
      "- Yes. How do you feel about that?\n",
      "- Yeah, it seems like okay. It seems okay I think… It’s a lot of work, I thought that it would automatically just find the content. But if I have to like put the link to the content in… Is it going to show up on the wellness category, or is it going to show up in my feed thingy (profile)?\n",
      "- You can choose the category you want to have.\n",
      "- *Goes through the curating with a link.* Um, okay. *Not convinced.*\n",
      "- You would be able to connect your Instagram, if you want to have your personal options there and things like that, and the idea is that you could also add content from someone else, like an interesting article, podcast, whatever it is, that you think is valuable for other things. So Instagram and things like that are more of who you are, how do you look like, who is your friend and family and things like that. This would be more who you are as a person what do you consume, what kind of content, what are the themes you are interested in, and things like that…\n",
      "- So its basically a platform that helps people figure out like my interests?\n",
      "- What do you think about, since you said that you are saving a lot of posts and you have folders there, how do you feel if you would have this type of profile if you save from TikTok, Instagram or Pinterest, all of the posts would be on the same page? Would you like it to be only for you or your friends or publicly?\n",
      "- I think there needs to be content that I like for me. I think some content I save I don’t want others to see. I think there needs to be like a public thing and private.\n",
      "- Do you share content in closed communities, friends, meaning send interesting reads/listens to someone?\n",
      "- Honestly, sometimes I do share, but I don’t share all the content I have saved. I do send, but in the end of the day I do like my privacy. There is content that is for you and then content that you want to share with other people. So I think any platform like this should allow people the choice.\n",
      "- Have you had an experience where you wished you could only follow part of the person?\n",
      "- Yeah. Like especially if someone is not niched down, and they just post broadly and talk about things that are irrelevant for me. I don’t want to see content from you, but I followed you because of this type of content. That would be great.\n",
      "- Is that more towards work related stuff or is that in general?\n",
      "- In general. It also depends on what is the main goal of the platform right now. Is it so that people share content with each other and you can see what other people are into? Or is it more like get to know someone on a personal level? Or is it more of you can find all content from everywhere that is relevant for you, and then you can choose and then it’s on this platform? *Questioning what is the main point of this.*\n",
      "#########################\n",
      "- What do you think would be the most valuable thing for you?\n",
      "- I think a place where all the content is unified is a nice touch… *She is suspicious.* Umm, yeah. It’s a nice little touch… But I don’t know… Because the content has to be somewhere, and so…\n",
      "- Yeah, you wouldn’t generate content here.\n",
      "- Yeah, but then its a thing if all it does is – it’s basically a Google for content creation? *Laughs.* And um then it’s a thing how would I use it, like long term wise, and the turn rate might be high. Because you have to go there, if I could actually go to the platforms to check it out myself, and so… *Doesn’t find value in combining social media platforms and discovering content that way.*\n",
      "- Maybe like a more personal approach would be best for me. If I like could follow a few people and check out what they like on a more personal level. But the searching for content and stuff like that, I think for any person who is in the marketing space or any person that is an avid user of social media spaces – they actually know how to get content. And so getting to know people, that would be what I would lean more towards, a bit. *Still not really convinced, just picking the other option.*\n",
      "- Is there a feature you saw that would not be for you?\n",
      "- Honestly what I would not find valuable for me, if the person is not relevant for me, I wouldn’t really care what they are following (or saving). If I actually want to follow the person and see what they are up to or into… Other than that, I don’t think seeing what they like or all of that is not really valuable for me. *Probably she would just follow the people she “actually wants to follow” on the other platforms and not here. Doesn’t find it too valuable to see others saved posts.*\n",
      "- However, if it was more like to meet likeminded people and people who like the same things as you and engage with them on the platform, sharing podcasts etc. and being a part of the community with same interests as you. That would be a bit more valuable. But yeah…\n",
      "- Who could benefit from a platform like this the most?\n",
      "- I think it would be people who want to figure out some new stuff, to find out what’s trending on different platforms. Like marketers… I don’t see what value there would be for an average person to know whats trending. Unless they want specific content for them. But I think the biggest value they would get would be the interaction with other people on the platform and seeing what they are into and stuff like that. It also depends what you use the platform for. *What is it for is not clear/simple.*\n",
      "- For who is this platform not suitable for?\n",
      "- Just people who want to create content on a daily. Or people that just already have the set people that they follow, so they already get the updates on Spotify, they already get the updates on Linkedin etc. automatically for them. It would be most for people who search for something, instead of people who have actually found what they want.\n",
      "- I thought it was going to be like a platform where a lot of people are on it, you could see the content they are into and it was going to be this whole community based thing where you get to link up with like minded people and stuff like that. But if its like oh you can see what they like, maybe you can like it as well, but then there is no interaction with people. Then its a question like I could do that on Instagram, or TikTok.\n",
      "- What kind of interaction do you think a platform like this would need to be valuable for you?\n",
      "- I think… I don’t know. But I think something more community building stuff. That would work a bit.\n",
      "- Or in general, you said that you thought this would be more community based and find people so can you tell a bit more about that?\n",
      "- I like that approach. The world has become quite lonely to be honest, and it’s harder to find people especially as an adult. As an adult it’s difficult since you outgrow people and have new interests. Where am I going to find people with the same interests as me? So if it’s a platform where I can see these people are on this are and they like these things. Then it’s more about “oo I like the content that they are sharing” and maybe some sort of interaction or some meetups and something like that. In that way I think it would bring the most value. *For her the pain is based on some frogs 1.0.*\n",

      "- I think most of the time yes, but Instagram is very distracting. Once I open it for something else I see posts, like celebrities or fashion and things, and I’m easily distracted. That part is not so nice, but I can’t get rid of those either, they are everywhere. It’s relevant and not relevant at the same time. *Could want to block some topics / have specific things shown.*\n",
      "- What factors prevent you from solving these problems?\n",
      "- Thinking… Saving is one of the methods. Otherwise, I try not to follow distracting things. So that the recommendation algorithm recommends – but it recommends those anyway. Not easy to solve, this distraction part.\n",
      "- How much time do you spend across these platforms?\n",
      "- Depends on my day, but on the days I listen to a podcast for example, it could be 1h in a podcast or Youtube. Instagram could be anything from 20 minutes to an hour.\n",

I found this AI that is called Agent AI(?) and you just give it a prompt and it gives you all the info you need, like statistics. Sometimes I use Pinterest, sometimes I use Instagram. I don’t like it, but sometimes I need to go on TikTok.\n",

      "- Do you use Youtube at all?\n",
      "- I mean I use Youtube, but its more for when I don’t understand a topic and it has someone explain it. I don’t really use it to watch someone vlog or watch product recommendations – I don’t do it for that. Because I just know that a lot of the content on Youtube is for ratings. A lot of it is also for marketing purposes, so a lot of the reviews are biased.\n",
      "- How much time do you spend across these platforms?\n",
      "- Screen time is 5 hours a day on social networks.\n",

      "- Is the content you see often relevant or irrelevant for you during those 5 hours?\n",
      "- I think its a combination of both. I don’t scroll for 5 hours straight, but if I need to find something I go on and search. But I do find sometimes when I’m on there for a work thing, I’m like “oo what is this” and get out of track a bit. And I do use my social media in a way that the timeline is curated and is mostly relevant for me. I like posts based on what I want to see more. Even if I see something funny, but not as relevant, I don’t like it – just because I don’t want to mess up my zen feeling and having unnecessary people show up.\n",
      "- How do you feel about customized feeds, like TikTok for you or Instagram explore pages?\n",
      "- I think when we talk about hyper personalization, its one thing – but I think social media shouldn’t be controlled to that extend. It also creates a bubble for that person.

      "- Yes, if I’m like I want to recreate this video or a TikTok. Or if I really like a Youtube video, I will save it. So yes, I save all the time. But I have like over a thousand things I never go back to. I have tried to clean it up, but it requires too much work. Everyday I keep saving new stuff and keep saying I will get back to it but I don’t.\n",
      "- Do you feel like you would want to go back to them or not really?\n",
      "- Yeah, earlier especially on Instagram, you needed to scroll all the way down, but now you can put them on all different folders. So it’s easier to go through all the different content, because I can go to specific topics.\n",
      "- Is there still something that could be better on the Instagram saved folders?\n",
      "- Yeah. The one thing I actually hate is that you first need to save it and then put it in a folder – I would like it to automatically go to a folder. Extra step there, now its saved, now choose a folder… No, it should be like I click there “add” and it should say which folder you want to add it to, or if you want to create a folder directly.\n",
      "- What do you think about new platforms like Threads by Instagram?\n",
      "- For example like Threads, I have a whole another thing about Threads, because I know Threads is not on Finland. My cousins were calling me “Where do you live, under a rock? How come you are not on Threads?”. So, I don’t know, if you delete someone from Threads you delete them from Instagram and vice versa.\n",
      "- And I think Threads is highly regulated. I’m not with using platforms that are highly regulated. Because regulation and censorship can go both ways. I think people should have the right to say what they want to say. I believe as long as its not misogynistic, racist or totally terroristic. Freedom of speech is a basic human right.

      "- So you would like to keep them separate?\n",

      "- App is very self explanatory, you see what you want and you can go on it. For me the main thing is the content itself, and content being as relevant as possible to the topic. For me some of these *(contents)* I have seen before. To make the app more yours, you would see a lot of content you wouldn’t see on other platforms. I think that’s the most important thing because when you go an look at other platforms, you see a lot of same things and I don’t think that’s what you want. But I like this a lot, also podcasts as a source could be nice. I like that there are different formats – video, audio – very helpful. But also with the categories themselves, I like sub-categories *(runnings → shoes, playlist…)*, makes you feel more inspired to do it. Is the app like an everyday kinda thing or for research?\n",
      "- I realized the timer – is it to realize how much time you spend on the app?\n",
      "- How does the timer make you feel?\n",
      "- I like the idea of setting a timer. And I also like that if the time goes over you can reset it, because we put timers on apps, but we also want to use it more – so I like that you can also change it and it’s not super fixed.\n",

      "- I think it’s smart, because a lot of people will follow people for their name and not for their content. So I think that’s really smart especially when it comes to the pictures in general.\n",
      "- Profile & saving content from different platforms: Is that something you would be interested in doing?\n",
      "- Okay. Yeah, personally yes, especially what I said before I go back to images. Its nice to see them all laid next to each other clearly. Especially if I want to do folders like food, fashion, exercise – I think that’s good. *Would like to try it but is not a pain point.*\n",
      "- For example, when I want to save – how does that work? *Didn’t see it at first.*\n",

      "- What was the last time you used filters to find something online?\n",
      "- Not that much. I know people who do. I personally don’t like to filter too much when searching, since it is limiting. Most of the people tell that you should filter. I think its a good balance here since I can choose. I like the way I can filter here instead on other websites. *Highlighting that other people do that, but filtering is not the behavior for her. Surprising that then likes the filters here, but do we trust more on past behavior? Would be great to know how the filters are limiting.*\n",

There are people who prefer that, but in my case I don’t care if people have similar interests – or maybe I would rather see the content than their profile. Instagram suggested posts have the profile on top of the picture, not only the profile.\n",

      "- Have you had an experience where you wished you could only follow part of the person?\n",

      "- But when the person adds the post, do they need to tag the category and organize it?\n",

      "- Um, I think yeah – I think I would like people to see. It’s for just creating and artistic people – it can be a tricky one, since people can steal your references. But it’s also really inspiring to see one of your favourite stylists, for example, references and where they get them and why, where they get their ideas. It depends on the person. Personally I would share it, on and off. Maybe share a few, but not all. But I think sharing your saves is a cool idea.\n",

So Instagram and things like that are more of who you are, how do you look like, who is your friend and family and things like that.
